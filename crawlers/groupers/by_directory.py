# 1. Create grouping class (see MatIO grouper) with a 'group' function that inputs a list of paths.
# 2. Create family object.
# 3. Create empty group.
# 4. Put all files into 1 group. Add the group to family.
# 5. Return the family.
# 6. Adjust the globus_base.py code to allow an 'if grouper == 'by_directory':..." ...
# 7. The rest of the workflow should fall into place.
